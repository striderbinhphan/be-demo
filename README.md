# Demo be app

![Context]
You have been tasked to build APIs to support our frontend (web & mobile) teams for the sections circled (in red) in the image above.
These sections are known as the Fixtures module, and we will need APIs to support Fixtures Listing and Fixtures Calendar to display
only dates with matches.
